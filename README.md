# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Java Swing and AWT. Players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. It highlights the winner, declares ties, and includes a "Restart" button. Great for learning Java GUI programming, with potential for AI, score tracking, and design upgrade
